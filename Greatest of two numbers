import java.util.Scanner;
public class Compare
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    int a=sc.nextInt();
    int b=sc.nextInt();
    if (a==b)
    {
        System.out.println(a+" is equal to "+b);
    }
    else if(a>b)
    {
         System.out.println(a+" is greater than "+b);
    }

    else
    System.out.println(a+" is less than "+b);
    }
