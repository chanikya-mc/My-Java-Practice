{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {

        int p=sc.nextInt();
        int d=sc.nextInt();
        int y=sc.nextInt();
        long sum=p;
        for (int i=1;i<=y;i++)
           {
               
               sum=((100-d)*sum)/100;
           }
         System.out.println(sum);
