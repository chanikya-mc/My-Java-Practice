CODING:
import java.util.Scanner;
class Oscar2
{
    void m1()
    {
        System.out.println("Leo finally won the oscar! Leo is happy");
    
    }
    void m2()
    {
        System.out.println("Not even for Wolf of wallstreet?!");
    }
    void m3()
    {
       System.out.println("When will you give Leo an Oscar?");
    }
    void m4()
    {
        System.out.println("Leo got one already!");
    }
    
}
class Oscar
{
    public static void main(String[] args )
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int x=sc.nextInt();
        Oscar2 o=new Oscar2();
        if(x==88)
        {
            o.m1();
        }
        else if(x==86)
        {
            o.m2();
        }
        else if(x<86 || x==87)
        {
            o.m3();
        }
        else
        {
            o.m4();
        }
    }
