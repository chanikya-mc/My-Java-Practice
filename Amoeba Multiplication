Amoeba Multiplication

The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy

Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.

[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest to output]

Sample input and Output 1:

Enter the number of Months :

7

The amoeba size is 8

Sample input and Output 2:

Enter the number of Months :

12

The amoeba size is 89
CODING:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Amoeba
{
    public static void main(String args[])  
{  Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
 int n1=0,n2=1,i;
 int n3;
 System.out.println("Enter the number of Months :");
 int c=sc.nextInt();
 for(i=2;i<c;++i)    
 {    
  n3=n1+n2;    
  n1=n2;    
  n2=n3;  
  
 } 
 
 System.out.print("The amoeba size is "+n2);

  
}}
